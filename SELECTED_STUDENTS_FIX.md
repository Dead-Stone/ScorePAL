# Selected Students Grading Fix

## Issue
User selected only one student but the system was processing all submissions instead of just the selected student.

## Root Cause
The Canvas Integration page had student selection functionality (checkboxes), but the backend endpoint wasn't properly using the selected students list. The grading workflow was calling the old `process_assignment()` method which processes ALL students instead of just selected ones.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Backend Endpoint Fix (`backend/api/canvas_routes.py`)

**Modified endpoint**: `/courses/{course_id}/assignments/{assignment_id}/grade`

**Changes**:
- Now properly receives `selected_students` from request body
- Saves student selection using `select_students_for_grading()` before grading
- Checks for selected students and uses `grade_selected_students_only()` if any are selected
- Falls back to processing all students only if no students are selected

```python
# Get rubric_id and selected_students from request body
selected_students = body.get('selected_students', [])

# If students are selected, save the selection first
if selected_students and len(selected_students) > 0:
    canvas_service.select_students_for_grading(course_id, assignment_id, selected_student_ids)
    
# Check for selected students and use appropriate grading method
selection_status = canvas_service.get_selection_status(course_id, assignment_id)
if selection_status.get('success') and selection_status.get('data', {}).get('selected_students', []):
    # Grade only selected students
    results = canvas_service.grade_selected_students_only(course_id, assignment_id)
else:
    # Grade all students (fallback)
    success, message, results = canvas_service.process_assignment(course_id, assignment_id, output_dir, rubric)
```

### 2. Frontend Improvements (`frontend/src/pages/canvas.tsx`)

**Changes**:
- Updated button text to "Grade Selected Students (PDF Only)"
- Added informational alert explaining PDF-only grading and selected students functionality
- Fixed the workflow to properly send selected students to backend

**New Information Alert**:
```
• Only PDF files are currently supported for AI grading
• Non-PDF files (code, images, etc.) will show "Coming Soon" status  
• Only selected students will be graded (use checkboxes above)
• Files are downloaded directly from Canvas using submission URLs
```

### 3. PDF-Only Grading Integration

The selected students grading now properly integrates with the PDF-only grading logic:
- **PDF files**: Downloaded from Canvas URLs and graded with AI
- **Non-PDF files**: Marked with "Coming Soon" status
- **Mixed submissions**: PDFs graded, non-PDFs noted in feedback

## How It Works Now

1. **User Selection**: User checks boxes next to students they want to grade
2. **Save Selection**: When "Grade Selected Students" is clicked, selection is saved to backend
3. **Intelligent Grading**: Backend checks for selected students and only processes those
4. **File Type Handling**: Only PDF files are graded, others get "Coming Soon" status
5. **Results Display**: Results table shows proper status for each student

## Key Files Modified

1. `backend/api/canvas_routes.py` - Fixed grading endpoint logic
2. `frontend/src/pages/canvas.tsx` - Added info alert and improved UI
3. `backend/canvas_service.py` - Enhanced selected students grading (already implemented)

## Testing

The fix ensures that:
- ✅ Only selected students are processed (not all students)
- ✅ PDF files are downloaded from Canvas URLs and graded
- ✅ Non-PDF files get appropriate "Coming Soon" status
- ✅ Selection is properly saved and respected
- ✅ UI clearly shows what will be processed

## Result

The Canvas Integration page now respects student selection just like the LMS page, ensuring users get exactly what they expect when they select specific students for grading.
