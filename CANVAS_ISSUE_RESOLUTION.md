# Canvas Integration Issue Resolution

## Issues Identified

### 1. Canvas Integration Not Visible in Sidebar
**Problem**: Canvas integration disappeared from the sidebar navigation.

**Root Cause**: The sidebar visibility is controlled by `integrationStatus.canvas` which is loaded from `localStorage.getItem('integrations_enabled')`. This value was not properly set or was cleared.

**Solution**: 
- **Quick Fix**: Run this in browser console:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('integrations_enabled', JSON.stringify({canvas: true, moodle: false}));
```
- **Permanent Fix**: Go to Settings → Configure Canvas → Test Connection → Save Settings

### 2. Canvas Submission Processing Errors  
**Problem**: All Canvas submissions failing with `'submission_file'` error during processing.

**Root Cause**: Data structure mismatch between:
- **New Structure** (returned by `batch_download_submissions`): Uses `files` array with metadata
- **Old Processing** (in `process_assignment`): Expected `submission_file` and `question_paper` keys

**Error Pattern**:
```
ERROR:canvas_service:Error processing submission for user [NAME]: 'submission_file'
```

## Fixed Implementation

### Updated `canvas_service.py` Process Assignment Method

The `process_assignment` method now:

1. **Handles New File Structure**:
   - Processes `files` array instead of expecting `submission_file`
   - Extracts text from all downloaded files in each submission
   - Combines multiple files with clear delimiters

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Better logging for file processing status
   - Tracks which files were successfully processed
   - Provides detailed error messages

3. **Question Paper Support**:
   - Automatically looks for question paper in assignment metadata directory
   - Gracefully handles missing question papers

### Key Changes Made

```python
# OLD: Expected submission_file directly
submission_file = Path(submission_info['submission_file'])

# NEW: Process all files in the files array
for file_info in submission_info['files']:
    if file_info.get('download_status') == 'success':
        file_path = Path(file_info['absolute_path'])
        file_text = self.file_preprocessor.extract_text_from_file(file_path)
        submission_text += f"\n=== {file_info['original_name']} ===\n{file_text}\n"
```

## File Structure Overview

The Canvas integration now uses this organized structure:
```
submissions/
├── course_{course_id}/
│   └── assignment_{assignment_id}/
│       ├── metadata/
│       │   ├── assignment_info.json
│       │   ├── question_paper.html
│       │   └── sync_info.json
│       ├── submissions/
│       │   └── student_{user_id}/
│       │       ├── files/
│       │       │   └── [downloaded_files]
│       │       ├── metadata.json
│       │       └── grading_results.json
│       └── batch_results/
│           ├── grading_batch.json
│           └── selected_students.json
```

## How to Restore Canvas Integration

### Option 1: Quick Browser Fix
1. Open your browser's Developer Console (F12 → Console)
2. Paste and run:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('integrations_enabled', JSON.stringify({canvas: true, moodle: false}));
```
3. Refresh the page

### Option 2: Through Settings Page
1. Go to **Settings** in the sidebar
2. Enter your Canvas API Key
3. Click **"Test Connection"**
4. Toggle **"Enable Canvas Integration"** to ON
5. Click **"Save Settings"**

### Option 3: Use the Fix Script
1. Open browser console
2. Copy the contents of `frontend/src/utils/fix-canvas-integration.js`
3. Paste and run in console
4. Refresh the page

## Verification

After applying the fixes:

1. **Canvas Sidebar**: Should appear under "Integrations" section
2. **Submission Processing**: Should process all student files without errors
3. **Logging**: Should show successful file processing instead of errors

## Testing the Fix

To test if the submission processing is working:
1. Go to Canvas integration
2. Select a course and assignment
3. Start the grading process
4. Check logs for successful file processing messages instead of errors

## Prevention

To prevent these issues in the future:
1. Always save settings after configuring Canvas
2. Regularly backup localStorage data
3. Monitor logs for data structure changes
4. Use the newer file-based processing methods

## Technical Notes

- The fix maintains backward compatibility
- All existing functionality is preserved
- Enhanced error reporting for better debugging
- Improved file processing with support for multiple file types
