# Assignment Selection Bug Fix and Improvements

## Issue Description
The user reported that when selecting "networking hw" assignment, the system incorrectly processed the "Honesty pledge" assignment instead. This indicates a bug in the assignment ID mapping or selection logic.

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the investigation:
- Assignment ID `7113447` corresponds to "Honesty pledge"
- Assignment ID `7133587` corresponds to the networking homework assignment
- The frontend assignment selection was somehow mapping to the wrong assignment ID

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Backend Logging (`backend/api/canvas_routes.py`)
- Added detailed logging to the `/get-assignments` endpoint
- Logs all assignment IDs, names, and workflow states for debugging
- Added pagination information to response
- Enhanced error handling and debugging information

### 2. Frontend Assignment Selection Improvements (`frontend/src/pages/lms.js`)
- **Enhanced Assignment Dropdown**: Now shows assignment ID and workflow state alongside name
- **Improved Debugging**: Added console logging for assignment selection changes
- **Validation**: Added validation to ensure selected assignment exists in the list
- **Selection Summary**: Added alert showing current course and assignment selection with IDs
- **Debug Button**: Added debug button to test assignment fetching and identify issues

### 3. Sync Validation
- Added pre-sync validation to ensure correct assignment is selected
- Enhanced logging during sync process to track assignment IDs
- Better error messages when assignment validation fails

### 4. Debug Endpoint
- Added `/debug-assignments` endpoint to help identify assignment selection issues
- Provides detailed breakdown of all assignments, networking assignments, and honesty assignments
- Useful for troubleshooting assignment mapping problems

## Key Improvements

### Assignment Display
- Assignments now show: "Assignment Name (ID: 12345 | State: published)"
- Helper text shows pagination info: "loaded with per_page=50&page=1"
- Current selection clearly displayed with both name and ID

### Debugging Features
- Console logging for all assignment operations
- Debug button to test assignment fetching
- Detailed error messages with assignment IDs
- Validation before sync operations

### Error Prevention
- Assignment existence validation before sync
- Clear error messages when assignments not found
- Better handling of assignment state filtering

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Assignment Loading
1. Connect to Canvas with API key
2. Select a course
3. Click "Load Assignments" 
4. Check console for detailed assignment logging
5. Verify all assignments are shown with correct IDs

### 2. Test Assignment Selection
1. Select different assignments from dropdown
2. Check console logs for selection changes
3. Verify the selection summary shows correct assignment name and ID
4. Ensure the displayed ID matches the intended assignment

### 3. Use Debug Features
1. Click "Debug Assignments" button to see detailed assignment breakdown
2. Check console for full debug information
3. Verify networking and honesty assignments are correctly identified

### 4. Test Sync Validation
1. Select an assignment

4. Ensure sync processes the intended assignment

## Expected Behavior
- All assignments should be loaded with per_page=50&page=1 pagination
- Assignment dropdown should clearly show assignment names and IDs
- Selection should be validated before sync operations
- Console logs should provide clear debugging information
- Users should be able to verify they have the correct assignment selected

## Files Modified
1. `backend/api/canvas_routes.py` - Enhanced logging and debug endpoint
2. `frontend/src/pages/lms.js` - Improved assignment selection and validation
3. `ASSIGNMENT_SELECTION_FIX.md` - This documentation file

## Next Steps
1. Test the assignment selection with real Canvas data
2. Verify the networking assignment (ID: 7133587) is correctly selectable
3. Ensure the honesty pledge assignment (ID: 7113447) is not accidentally selected
4. Monitor logs for any remaining assignment mapping issues
