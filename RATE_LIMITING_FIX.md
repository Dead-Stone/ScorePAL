# Rate Limiting Fix and Grading Results Display

## Issues Resolved

### 1. API Rate Limiting (429 Errors)
**Problem**: The system was hitting Gemini API quota limits, causing grading failures with 429 errors.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive rate limiting and retry logic:

#### Backend Changes (`backend/grading_v2.py`):
- Added exponential backoff with jitter
- Intelligent retry delay extraction from error messages  
- Maximum 3 retries with cap at 120 seconds
- Graceful degradation for non-rate-limit errors

```python
def _handle_rate_limit(self, attempt: int, error_message: str) -> int:
    # Extract retry delay from error message if present
    retry_delay_match = re.search(r'retry_delay\s*{\s*seconds:\s*(\d+)', error_message)
    if retry_delay_match:
        suggested_delay = int(retry_delay_match.group(1))
    else:
        # Calculate exponential backoff: base_delay * 2^attempt + jitter
        suggested_delay = self.base_delay * (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
    
    # Cap the delay at 120 seconds
    delay = min(suggested_delay, 120)
    
    logger.warning(f"Rate limit hit on attempt {attempt + 1}. Waiting {delay} seconds before retry...")
    time.sleep(delay)
    
    return delay
```

### 2. Enhanced Grading Results Display

**Problem**: No proper way to view graded student results in a comprehensive table format.

**Solution**: Implemented a complete grading results display system:

#### Frontend Enhancements (`frontend/src/pages/lms.js`):
- **Enhanced Results Table**: Comprehensive display with student info, scores, grades, status
- **Summary Statistics**: Total students, graded count, failed count, average scores
- **Detailed Feedback Dialog**: Full feedback viewing with criteria breakdown
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Refresh capabilities and status indicators
- **Better UX**: Color-coded status chips, tooltips, and action buttons

#### Backend Enhancements (`backend/canvas_service.py`):
- **Enhanced get_grading_results**: Better data formatting for table display
- **Grade Distribution**: Letter grade calculations and statistics
- **Comprehensive Status Tracking**: Ready, graded, failed, pending states
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and error reporting

#### New API Endpoint (`frontend/src/pages/api/canvas/get-grading-results.js`):
- Clean API wrapper for grading results
- Proper error handling and status codes
- Integration with backend grading service

### 3. Improved Error Handling

#### Rate Limit Detection:
```python
# Check if this is a rate limit error and break early if needed
if "rate limit" in error_msg.lower() or "429" in error_msg:
    logger.warning("Rate limit detected, stopping grading process")
    break
```

#### Comprehensive Error Tracking:
- Failed submission tracking with detailed error messages
- Graceful handling of missing files or unreadable content
- Proper status updates for different failure modes

### 4. Better User Experience

#### Assignment Selection Fixes:
- Enhanced debugging for assignment ID mapping issues
- Better validation to prevent wrong assignment selection
- Clear display of assignment IDs and names in dropdowns

#### Results Display Features:
- **Status Indicators**: Clear visual representation of grading status
- **Score Breakdown**: Points, percentages, and letter grades
- **File Information**: Count and types of submitted files
- **Feedback Preview**: Truncated feedback with full view option
- **Action Buttons**: View details, download files, export results

## Current Assignment Processing Status

Based on the logs, Assignment ID `7154541` is being processed and appears to be the networking assignment (based on file names like "Tcpdump HW#2"). The system now:

1. **Handles Rate Limits Gracefully**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
2. **Displays Results Properly**: Comprehensive table with all student data
3. **Provides Clear Status**: Visual indicators for grading progress and results
4. **Offers Enhanced Debugging**: Better error messages and assignment verification

## Usage Instructions

### To View Grading Results:
1. Select the correct course and assignment
2. Click "View Grading Results" button
3. Review the comprehensive results table
4. Use "Refresh Results" to get latest status
5. Click on student rows to view detailed feedback

### If Rate Limiting Occurs:
- The system will automatically retry with increasing delays
- Progress will be saved between retries
- Failed students will be clearly marked with error details
- You can resume grading later without losing progress

### For Assignment Selection Issues:
- Use the "Debug Assignments" button to verify assignment mapping
- Check the assignment ID and name in the selection summary
- Refresh assignments if needed to get latest data

## Files Modified

1. `backend/grading_v2.py` - Rate limiting and retry logic
2. `backend/canvas_service.py` - Enhanced results formatting and error handling
3. `frontend/src/pages/lms.js` - Results display table and UI improvements
4. `frontend/src/pages/api/canvas/get-grading-results.js` - New API endpoint
5. `backend/api/canvas_routes.py` - Enhanced debugging and logging

The system now provides a robust, user-friendly experience for viewing grading results while handling API limitations gracefully.
