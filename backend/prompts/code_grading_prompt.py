**PROGRAMMING ASSIGNMENT EVALUATION**

**Language:** {language.upper()}
**Style Guide Reference:** {lang_info['style_guide']}
**File Analysis:**
- Functions: {len(analysis.get('functions', []))}
- Classes: {len(analysis.get('classes', []))}
- Imports: {len(analysis.get('imports', []))}
- Comment Ratio: {analysis.get('comment_ratio', 0):.1%}

**CODE EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:**

**1. CORRECTNESS & FUNCTIONALITY**
- Does the code solve the intended problem?
- Are there logical errors or bugs?
- Does it handle edge cases appropriately?
- Are algorithms implemented correctly?

**2. CODE QUALITY & STYLE**
- Follows {lang_info['style_guide']} conventions
- Consistent naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
- Proper indentation and formatting
- {lang_info['key_features']}

**3. DOCUMENTATION & COMMENTS**
- Adequate inline comments explaining complex logic
- Function/method documentation
- Clear variable and function names (self-documenting code)
- Header comments where appropriate

**4. EFFICIENCY & BEST PRACTICES**
- Appropriate algorithm complexity
- Efficient use of data structures
- Avoids common pitfalls: {lang_info['common_issues']}
- Follows language-specific best practices

**5. STRUCTURE & ORGANIZATION**
- Logical code organization
- Proper separation of concerns
- Modular design (functions/classes used effectively)
- Clean architecture principles

**EXAMPLE EVALUATION:**

*Example: Python Function*

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    total = 0
    for num in numbers:
        total += num
    return total / len(numbers)
```

**Evaluation Process:**
Thought: Check correctness - function calculates average but doesn't handle empty list.
Action: Deduct points for missing error handling (division by zero).
Thought: Style looks clean, follows Python conventions.
Action: Full points for style and readability.
Thought: No documentation provided.
Action: Deduct points for missing docstring and comments.
Thought: Algorithm is correct but not optimal (could use built-in sum()).
Action: Partial credit for efficiency.

**SUBMISSION TO EVALUATE:**

{submission}

**GRADING RUBRIC:**
{rubric_json}

**EVALUATION INSTRUCTIONS:**

1. **Analyze the code structure and functionality**
   - Identify the main components (functions, classes, algorithms)
   - Check for correctness and logical flow
   - Look for potential bugs or issues

2. **Assess code quality**
   - Check adherence to {lang_info['style_guide']}
   - Evaluate naming conventions and readability
   - Look for {lang_info['key_features']}

3. **Evaluate documentation**
   - Check for appropriate comments and documentation
   - Assess code self-documentation through naming

4. **Check efficiency and best practices**
   - Identify algorithm complexity
   - Look for common issues: {lang_info['common_issues']}
   - Assess use of language-specific features

5. **Provide constructive feedback**
   - Highlight strengths in the code
   - Suggest specific improvements
   - Reference best practices and conventions

**GRADING APPROACH:**
Apply a {strictness_desc} grading standard (level {strictness_level} out of 5).
Consider both functional correctness and code quality equally important.

**CRITICAL SCORING RULES:**
1. **CALCULATE TOTAL FROM CRITERIA**: The "score" field MUST equal the sum of all "points" in criteria_scores
2. **VALIDATE POINTS**: Each criterion's "points" must be â‰¤ its "max_points"
3. **USE RUBRIC EXACTLY**: Use the exact criterion names and max_points from the provided rubric
4. **SHOW YOUR MATH**: Calculate the total step by step to ensure accuracy

**SCORING CALCULATION EXAMPLE:**
If criteria_scores = [
  {{"name": "Correctness", "points": 25, "max_points": 30}},
  {{"name": "Style", "points": 20, "max_points": 25}},
  {{"name": "Documentation", "points": 15, "max_points": 20}}
]
Then: score = 25 + 20 + 15 = 60 (NOT some other number)

**SELF-ASSESSMENT ACCURACY REQUIREMENTS:**
Before finalizing your response, evaluate your own grading accuracy:

1. **Mathematical Accuracy**: Are your calculations correct? Does the total equal the sum?
2. **Evidence Quality**: Did you provide specific examples and code references?
3. **Feedback Quality**: Is your feedback detailed, constructive, and actionable?
4. **Score Reasonableness**: Are your scores fair and well-distributed?

Rate each factor from 0.0 to 1.0 based on your confidence.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide only a JSON object in this exact format:

  "total": <sum_of_all_max_points_from_rubric>,
