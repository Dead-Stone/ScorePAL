# Agentic File Processing Update

## Issue Resolved
**Problem**: System was processing all students' files instead of only selected students' submissions.

**Solution**: Modified the agentic framework to process only selected students' files by downloading them on-demand from Canvas URLs and cleaning them up immediately after processing.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced FileProcessingTool (`backend/agentic_framework.py`)

**Before**: Only processed local files
```python
async def execute(self, file_path: str, file_type: str = None) -> str:
    return self.preprocessor.extract_text_from_file(file_path)
```

**After**: Downloads files from Canvas URLs and processes them with automatic cleanup
```python
async def execute(self, file_path: str = None, file_url: str = None, file_type: str = None, 
                 canvas_api_key: str = None, cleanup: bool = True) -> str:
    # Downloads from Canvas URL if provided
    # Creates temporary file
    # Processes and extracts text
    # Automatically deletes temporary file
```

### 2. Updated PreprocessingAgent (`backend/agentic_framework.py`)

**Before**: Expected files to be pre-downloaded locally
```python
for file_info in files:
    text = await self.tools['file_processor'].execute(file_path=file_info.get('path'))
```

**After**: Processes files directly from Canvas URLs for selected students only
```python
for attachment in attachments:
    file_url = attachment.get('url')
    text = await self.tools['file_processor'].execute(
        file_url=file_url,
        canvas_api_key=canvas_api_key,
        cleanup=True  # Always clean up temporary files
    )
```

### 3. Modified Canvas Grading Workflow (`backend/agentic_framework.py`)

**Enhancement**: Passes Canvas API key to preprocessing agents
```python
preprocessing_task = Task(
    type="process_submissions",
    payload={
        'submissions': submissions,
        'canvas_api_key': self.canvas_service.canvas_api_key if self.canvas_service else None
    }
)
```

### 4. Updated AgenticCanvasService (`backend/agentic_integration.py`)

**Before**: Used pre-downloaded files from local directories
```python
# Read files from local student directories
files_dir = student_dir / "files"
files = []
if files_dir.exists():
    for file_path in files_dir.iterdir():
        files.append({'path': str(file_path), 'name': file_path.name})
```

**After**: Fetches submissions directly from Canvas with URLs for selected students only
```python
# Get Canvas submissions directly with URLs for selected students only
submissions_result = self.canvas_service.get_submissions_for_assignment(
    course_id, assignment_id, include=['attachments']
)

# Filter to only selected students
for submission in all_submissions:
    if user_id in selected_user_ids:
        attachments = submission.get('attachments', [])
        submissions_data.append({
            'user_id': user_id,
            'user_name': user_name,
            'attachments': attachments,
            'submission_data': submission
        })
```

### 5. Enhanced Error Handling and Logging

- Added comprehensive logging for file processing steps
- Automatic cleanup of temporary files even if processing fails
- Detailed error messages for failed file downloads/processing

## Workflow Now

1. **Student Selection**: Only processes students selected by the user
2. **On-Demand Download**: Downloads files from Canvas URLs only when needed
3. **Immediate Processing**: Extracts text from downloaded files
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Deletes temporary files immediately after processing
5. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple students processed concurrently by different agents
6. **Error Resilience**: Continues processing other files if one fails

## Benefits

✅ **Efficient Resource Usage**: No unnecessary file downloads
✅ **Disk Space Conservation**: Temporary files cleaned up immediately  
✅ **Selected Students Only**: Processes exactly what user selected
✅ **Improved Performance**: No pre-downloading step required
✅ **Better Error Handling**: Graceful handling of download/processing failures
✅ **Real-time Processing**: Files processed as needed during grading workflow

## Testing

To verify the fix:
1. Select only 1 student in the frontend
2. Start grading workflow
3. Check logs to confirm only that 1 student is processed
4. Verify no temporary files remain after processing
5. Confirm grading results only for selected student

## Security & Compliance

- Uses proper Canvas API authentication
- Temporary files stored securely and deleted immediately
- No persistent storage of student files
- Maintains Canvas privacy and security standards
